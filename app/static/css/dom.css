/* DOM refers to the standard HTML elements.
 * There shouldn't be any class names or ids in here, just regular html tags.
 * If you override a dom element's style here, it should take effect across the entire app,
 * unless it's specifically styled by some other class somewhere else.
 * Also, you want to import this stylesheet before any of your other ones, so you can
 * overwrite these styles later on with more specific selectors.
